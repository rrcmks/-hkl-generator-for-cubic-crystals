# -hkl-generator-for-cubic-crystals
Simple Python code to simulate {h k l}, d-spacing for the plane and unit cell length ('a') for cubic crystals from XRD data.  Input '2-theta' data from X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as the possible maximum 'a' value in Angstroms. This can be extended to any crystal systems.
